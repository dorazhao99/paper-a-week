# Understanding and Mitigating Racial Biases in Image Captioning Techniques
A progress log and journal for my senior thesis on racial biases in image captioning. This is mainly for my personal use to keep track of where I am and interesting
articles that I may read along the way. 

Disclaimers: Any notes that I write do not reflect my personal views or those of the authors. These are rough summaries of the articles.
